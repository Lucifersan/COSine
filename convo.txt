Don’t forget to do your math homework. 
Can’t I’m busy. 
Busy with what? all you do is sit around at home. 
A friend asked me to compete in a hackathon
Hah what hackathon
…It’s called PrideHacks. it’s for pride month. 
That stuff for gay people. Why you doing that?
What’s wrong with gay people??
It’s not natural! A man should only be with a woman! 
Says who?
You don’t have life experience like your mother does. Listen to me.
There’s nothing wrong with two men loving each other, or two women loving each other
Of course it’s wrong. y/n, I hope you aren’t getting any gross ideas.
Actually…
y/n, tell me! I’m your mother!
I’m bisexual, ok?
Whats that huh? You don't like boys?
No, it means i like both boys and girls.
What’s wrong with you? I thought I raise you to be better than this
There’s nothing wrong with me!
Aiya, so you think i am a bad mother, haah? Don’t talk to me about this anymore. A proper girl shouldn’t think like this.
